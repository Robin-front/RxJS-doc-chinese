# Contributing to URI.js #

Thanks for your help!

Pull Requests go into the branch **master**. The *gh-pages* branch is a presentation of the *master* branch at the last given release.

Whenever you change code, make sure you run the test suite before sending a pull request. Please add tests for any features you add to the code base. We're using [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) for testing.

We're looking forward to splitting URI.js in several files, each dealing with a specific domain, to make the 1800 lines of code more bearable to work with. This will lead to using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build a distributable version (and the removal of `build.html`). We're not sure when we'll get to this. If you want to pitch in, just holler!
