# Observer object #

The Observer object provides support for push-style iteration over an observable sequence.

The Observer and Objects interfaces provide a generalized mechanism for push-based notification, also known as the observer design pattern. The Observable object represents the object that sends notifications (the provider); the Observer object represents the class that receives them (the observer).
