# Observable object #

The Observable object represents a push based collection.

The Observer and Objects interfaces provide a generalized mechanism for push-based notification, also known as the observer design pattern. The Observable object represents the object that sends notifications (the provider); the Observer object represents the class that receives them (the observer).
