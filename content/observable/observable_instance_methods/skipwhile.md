Bypasses elements in an observable sequence as long as a specified condition is true and then returns the remaining elements.

#### 参数
1. `predicate` *(`Function`)*: A function to test each source element for a condition. The callback is called with the following information:
    1. the value of the element
    2. the index of the element
    3. the Observable object being subscribed
2. `[thisArg]` *(`Any`)*: Object to use as this when executing callback.

#### 返回值
*(`Observable`)*: An observable sequence that contains the elements from the input sequence starting at the first element in the linear series that does not pass the test specified by predicate.
