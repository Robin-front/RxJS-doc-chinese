## [`Rx.Observable.prototype.let(func)`](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/src/core/linq/observable/let.js)

{% if book.isPdf %}



{% else %}



{% endif %}

Returns an observable sequence that is the result of invoking the selector on the source sequence, without sharing subscriptions.

This operator allows for a fluent style of writing queries that use the same sequence multiple times.  There is an alias of `letBind` for browsers older than IE 9.

#### Arguments
1. `func` *(`Function`)*: Selector function which can use the source sequence as many times as needed, without sharing subscriptions to the source sequence.

#### Returns
*(`Observable`)*: An observable sequence that contains the elements of a sequence produced by multicasting the source sequence within a selector function.
