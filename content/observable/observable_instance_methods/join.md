Correlates the elements of two sequences based on overlapping durations.

#### 参数
1. `right` *(`Observable`)*: The right observable sequence to join elements for.
2. `leftDurationSelector` *(`Function`)*: A function to select the duration (expressed as an observable sequence) of each element of the left observable sequence, used to determine overlap.
3. `rightDurationSelector` *(`Function`)*: A function to select the duration (expressed as an observable sequence) of each element of the right observable sequence, used to determine overlap.
4. `resultSelector` *(`Any`)*: A function invoked to compute a result element for any two overlapping elements of the left and right observable sequences. The parameters are as follows:
    1. *(`Any`)* Element from the left source for which the overlap occurs.
    2. *(`Any`)* Element from the right source for which the overlap occurs.

#### 返回值
*(`Observable`)*: An observable sequence that contains result elements computed from source elements that have an overlapping duration.
